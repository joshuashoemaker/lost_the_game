# lost_the_game
Entry for js13kbGames 2018. Loosely based on the theme Lost, a "hacking" simulation to track down kidnappers using the TOR network.

##To DOs
I still need to make the begining game narrative to set up the context and instructions. Also need to find interesting CSS tricks for screen aumentation and annnimations that wont blow up the project size.
