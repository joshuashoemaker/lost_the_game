            <p>Several months ago, your loved one Katlyen Hicks went missing. You have connections 
                do several deep and dark web users. They have informed you that they ave seen websites known for human 
                trafficing that have posted advertisements with her picture. These websites are only accessible by using
                the T.O.R network. A network designed to mask origins of internet conections to keep communications hidden.
                Like any system, it has its weak points. These dark web user friends of yours have taught you secrets of 
                the trade of computer hacking and tracking. You have now build a tool to help you narrorw down the source 
                of these website owners. The T.O.R. network masks its users by bouncing their signals all accross the globe 
                so much so that they are almost impossible to track. You however are able to track the different network nodes
                and find the roots of the signals. Your tool will allow you select IP addresses and determine if it is an actual 
                node being used. This tool will let you know how accurate your choice is so you can accuratly make a new selection.
                You only have so long before you are lockout out of the system's vulnerabilities. Use this toime appropriately, you 
                will need to lock onto several signals to find rthe capture of your loved one.
